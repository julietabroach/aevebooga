Just beat the main game with my wife and look forward to trying the free DLC. Everything about this game was so refreshing and cool. I loved how much communication it required and how it really felt like being at different stations on a space ship. I really wish this game could have made it to other platforms and reached a wider audience but unfortunately the uniqueness of the Wii U is both what made the game possible and doomed it to obscurity. » Скачать видео к Affordable Space Adventures » Скриншоты к Sims 3: Hidden Springs, The » Посмотреть видео из игры Legend of Grimrock.

We specialize in making you feel like part of our family, you will feel right They're in a humble bundle and I know noone with a Wii U, I got the bundle for the 3DS codes. Best joke wins I guess. EDIT - OFFER is closed Will send the keys to the two selected winners. Thanks for taking part guys Hi guys, I have two WiiU games codes, but I do not own a WiiU. If anyone would like either, 1. Affordable Space Adventures or 2. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse, please reply to this with the number you would like as well as the title of your favourite Nintendo game and why you like it? I will choose the two winners in a weeks time. Happy gaming. 
Have two Wii U codes, have both games already. Runbow - .99 Affordable Space Adventures - .99 Or, if you want both, I'll take  PayPal FampF. Maybe negotiable. Thanks I know a lot of folks are picking up the last few WiiU titles on their list before the Switch arrives, I would hate for anyone to miss out on Affordable Space Adventures because it's an eShop exclusive. If you've never heard of it, it's a puzzle adventure for 1 to 3 players. The gamepad becomes the ship's control panel, and one player mans the controls (landing gear, exhaust ports, etc) while another player uses a wiimote/pro controller to steer the ship. This is the exact sort of asymmetrical. Looking for any offers. So as you may or may not know, Humble Bundle (https://www.humblebundle.com/friends-of-nintendo-3ds-wiiu) is having a sale right now for Nintendo's Wii U and 3DS. Seeing a few games I was interested in, I payed  and got everything. What really peaked my interest, however, was Affordable Space Adventure  I had no clue what it was based on the title, but it sounded cute and I wanted to give it a shot. ____ As soon as the game started, however, I immediately assumed it was a horror game. I'd love to see the boys play Affordable Space Adventures on the Wii U. It is one of the most memorable co-op games I can recall and it's specifically for 3 players. (You can play it with one or two, but the more the merrier.) I doubt the boys would finish It, but it is so easy for me to see Ding Dong and Julian screaming at Chris for beeping his horn during a particularly tense sneak. Finally tried ASA. Holy crap is this a good game. Great aesthetics and world building wrapped around a clever 2-D puzzle game with short levels and frequent save points. Similarly to “Gamer” in Game and Wario, the gamepad functions as the ship control panel and works great. ESSENTIAL. Anyone looking to trade for their extra humble bundle. 
Hey folks, bought the Friends of Nintendo Humble Bundle, but really only wanted to play Shantae. I also discovered a few indie games that I never redeemed from a Humble Bundle awhile back, so going to get rid of those too. Here's the full list. - Retro City Rampage DX (3DS) - Afforable Space Adventures (Wii U) - Intrusion 2 (Steam) - ~~Oil Rush (Steam)~~ - ~~Tiny and Big in Grandpa's Leftovers (Steam)~~ - ~~English Country Tune (Steam)~~ --- To enter, all you need to do is. - Post which.

Who we are: I’m Lau Korsgaard (/u/EnButtetSkude), Game Designer at KnapNok Games, an indie studio based in Copenhagen, Denmark, where we are currently finishing our game Affordable Space Adventures. Our previous game Spin the Bottle: Bumpie’s Party got some attention for using the Wii U Gamepad in new ways. I won’t be doing this alone, however. I have Nicklas Nygren (/u/NicklasNygren), from Nifflas’ Games, our Game Director, and Anchel Labena (/u/Anchelspain), PR guy, joining Now I can't speak for the rest of the Friends of Nintendo Humble Bundle (https://www.humblebundle.com/friends-of-nintendo-3ds-wiiu) as I didn't play them yet, but not only are these games very fun, they make smart use of the gamepad that we don't see very often (even from Nintendo). When Nintendo was advertising games like ZombiU, Rayman Legends and NintendoLand this is the kind of thing they were trying to promote. Sadly it didn't gain traction and even Nintendo walked away from meaningfu. I love that ASA was interesting and co-operative but in different ways. My young son and I would play together often and have a blast, but I could also play it alone. We tried StarFox Zero but it was too much shooting and not enough communication. Are there any other games that are similar to ASA? I was hoping we'd get "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes" but apparently it was never ported What i can come up with is just slower descending(?)
