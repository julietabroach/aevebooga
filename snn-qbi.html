Looking on my K-1 from a 1065, I noticed TT overstates QBI. Specifically, it does not take into consideration unreimbursed partnership expenses or the deductible portion of self-employment.

For financial advisors, the new Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction (also known as the IRC Section 199A deduction, or the pass-through deduction) presents. I'm not sure if this is a TurboTax issue, user knowledge of TurboTax problem, some misunderstanding of the QBI rule, or some loophole. We have a few rental houses, as well as another business that qualifies for QBI too. The rentals combined are not making money, and have carried over losses from prior years.
