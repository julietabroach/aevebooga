My hard drive crashed the other day. So I figured I'd dual boot windows/mint finally. The problem is I installed linuxmint using drivedroid on my android phone, and can't get it working with a windows iso as my internal storage on the phone is too small. So I've been looking for a program on linux that will allow me to turn a usb flash drive into a bootable windows disk. Unfortunately I've found nothing for linux that supports it.

I went through the hoops of trying to install my Windows 7 copy onto a USB so that I can install it on a PC that doesn't have a disk drive.

Please contact the device manufacturer for recovery options." Please. 
Hi Reddit, I am building a PC (Ryzen 7 1700 and Fatal1ty AB350 gaming motherboard) but can't seem to install windows 7 from my ISO file. As soon as I get to the install screen the keyboard and mouse stop working. I've tried every USB port and tried disabling USB 3.0 from the BIOS, but still have the same problem. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks. Question: Would an ISO copy of Windows 7 SP1 64-bit downloaded from the Microsoft website today be more up to date than my OEM DVD copy of Windows 7 SP1 64-bit purchased in 2011? Background: I recently built a PC and installed Windows 7 SP1 64bit using an OEM DVD I bought back in 2011. Several hours after the install was complete there were 225 Windows updates ready to be installed upon shutdown. Windows choked on all the updates and threw a "Failure configuring Windows updates. Need a Win7 HP ISO image to download. Can some one please provide a working link? Thanks. I just installed Qubes, I'm no linux n00b, but for some reason when I issue a "qvm-start Windows --cdrom=/Win7.iso" the vm starts, and the hypervisor loads the vm DB, then poof. System reboot! I have 16gb ram, and "Windows HVM" is set to use 8gb. You might wonder why I am trying this. short answer my wife doesn't want to learn how to use a new os. Should I try a new iso? Should I not try to load an iso from "/"? If you want logs, tell me which ones, and ill pastebin. So my glorious brothers (and sisters), I have SSDs to install on now, but I can't just migrate my installation as it stands since my boot drive is a RAID array of larger size than either of my SSDs. We all know Windows Update is total ass though, and very slow. Is there a way to get a more current Win7 ISO to install with for a clean install on new drives? EDIT: Forgot to mention I have Home Premium. My work has tasked me to construct a few dozen Windows 7 VM's for an upcoming exercise. They didn't give me a license, but want me to construct with a trial version that they will provide the license for. I can't seem to find one. Any ideas. I'm downloading the 64 bit Windows 7 Professional SP1-U ISO, because I'm pretty sure that's what my OEM is (he lists something about an "N" version, but I don't know what that is). I want to try and do the "create with CMD" option too, just in case I have any issues with that. The catch is that there are two listed methods for creating the ISO and I'm not sure why I should use one or the other. I put linux on my laptop, and now microsoft has changed their download server from the one that used to give the ISO without any authentication, to now requiring me to enter the licence key. I entered the key under the laptop, but it wont let me as its an OEM key. can anyone help please? a mirrored download or something? the edition is windows 7 home premium I have Ubuntu 16.04 installed on my computer and I'm trying to dual boot windows 7 with it. I've set up my boot loader to prioritize my usb drive that has a copy of the win7 iso on it, but it just proceeds directly to the login screen on boot up. I read somewhere that it's best to have windows installed first and THEN install linux to dual boot (I had that mixed up evidently). Is there some way for me to know if the iso on my usb drive is going to work if I wipe my hard drive 
Background: the Laptop: this Toshiba is a Satellite C655 that originally had Win7. It is owned by an older friend and neighbor of mine who I barter car fix help for computer help. I have helped him with it from time to time over the years uninstalling crapware, fixing browser Hijacks and the like. When I first worked on it my friends brother had reverted the OS to Windows ME and it was running like crap. Years ago, my friend had signed up with some helpful crooks in India who had control. Hello! I recently bought an iBUYPOWER from Best Buy (BB951) for my son for Christmas and ran into a major issue last night. It suddenly went into BSD and I eventually had to wipe the drives and do a clean Win10 install. I noticed in another post that a Win7 ISO was provided via Dropbox. I was wondering if one is available for Win10? Having to reinstall all of these programs and set the up properly is becoming a bit of a pain and frankly I really don't wish to be spending this much time (approxim. As title says, I want to start posting some content to youtube, have already got >10 videos & clips but some need to be "stitched together" into 1 video, others need to have the first or last 30sec removed, stuff like that. I'm posting in the Noobs section despite not being a linux noob, but I'm a complete neophyte w/ video editing (have never done it before!) so hoping for some reco's, ideally 2 reco's- one that's the most basic/simple one, so I can get some of my stuff So! After a plethora of issues with 10, I decided I wanted to go back to Windows 7. All good, got my copy, formatted my onboad m.2 SSD. Restarted. No keyboard or mouse working? Thought that was strange, checked the internet, seemed to be an issue with 100 series motherboards (Gigabyte z170-hd3-cf) as they didn't integrate Windows 7 usb support out of the box. Found a tool to on gigabytes support page to integrate the proper usb fixes into a win7.iso Pulled out my ps2 keyboard As the title says, I have a HP Pavilion DV7 running Windows 7 Home Premium. It will not boot into windows off of any form of media I've tried. Won't boot to recovery partition either. I noticed my computer was having trouble with every program I opened, even in safe mode. It'd load relatively fine, then immediately begin not responding. I'll list out as many steps as I can remember trying. Ran RKILL, then Avast, Malwarebytes, and ADWCleaner. Nothing found and no change. I tried Edit: The issue has been solved, just scroll down for the solution Hello. I need to install virtualbox, but I can't get it to work. I have already setup my Win7.iso and all. But when I press start it gives me this error WARNING: The vboxdrv kernel module is not loaded.

Has anyone successfully been able to deploy Windows 7 Enterprise (x64) to the HP EliteDesk 8300 G3 model desktop? Speaking to HP the tech told me that only their OEM/prebuilt Win7 (Pro) image is supported on that hardware. I pulled the drivers from that image as well as downloading the driver pack from HP's website, but when I boot using the Win7 Enterprise ISO I cannot get the drive to show up. I saw one solution using OSD via SCCM, but we aren't using OSD currently.
