So all these news stories about “special people”( i mean disabled people people with autism ect) being made prom queen/king just seems insulting and patronizing. Im sure at at SOME school it was because they are a cool person but im betting not the majority. If they are looking at a person with autism as just a person with autism so you feel bad and make them prom queen. They are doing Assuming they would have had a reasonable amount of support upon ascending to the throne (enough to make them fairly secure in their new position and able to actually start governing), which of our players would have been the best ruler? (Assuming also that they were still alive, in the case of those that have been beheaded or blown up or jumped out a window.) Not looking at who could have somehow made the necessary plays to gain the throne, but who would've ruled/would rule decently A quiet hush spread through the throne room, interrupted only by the soft chiming of bells in the background. His Highness Vallas Galladria II was dead, leaving the kingdom in mourning. The end had come upon suddenly, it being only a few days since he was stricken with the Ghast. Whispers spread that he had been turned inside out by the wasting sickness, the once hale and nobleman reduced to a husk in mere days. Panic spread, as panic was inclined to do in these uncertain times. If the disease. 
Here's why: \-Overthrew one of the worst tyrants in Westeros history, and a centuries-long Targaryen dynasty that was largely characterized by civil war and strife throughout all Seven Kingdoms \-After the war, he pardoned many Targaryen loyalists as long as they bent the knee.he understood that war is war and some people deserve a second chance in peace time \-Presided over close to 20 years of pretty peaceful times, not counting the odd rebellion that was easily crushed \-Largely. There has been a lot of bad royalty throughout human history, but who was the worst King/Queen in your setting’s history? What kingdom did they rule? What did they do that made them so bad? What happened First let me preface this by posing a rhetorical question. Who is more appropriate amp deserving to hint the future King and Queen of the Iron Throne than the venerable, cherished EDDARD STARK??? No other avenue would be more apropos. After all, it should’ve been his seat all along since King Robert’s death in S1. There was a bunch of FORESHADOWING back in S1E4. No reason now to believe that Ned’s comment to Arya in King’s Landing midway through the episode wasn’t a part of that foresh. This occurred to me because at this point in the series, even tho I don’t think it will happen, I think Jamie (as well as Jon) would be a better ruler than Daenerys. Edit: did anyone else get messages from this clown /throwaway19969 claiming to spoil episode 4? And possibly the series. If so how do I report the user to reddit. Hi everyone!

Dunno about you guys but the thought of a Democracy at the end or some sort of small council makes me sick. What do you want? 1.King/Queen at end (bar bran) Jon/Dany/Cersi 2.Democracy (inc bran as king) Jon goes to wall 3. Wished white walkers killed them all because it would be better ending than number 2. DampD have ruined everything. I am heavily leaning towards option 3 myself. Bran Stark? Is that why all the betting odds are in his favor. This is just a fantasy matchup. Pick a council who you think will bring prosperity and peace to the realm. You guys can pick any character who have appeared on the TV Show. The positions on the small council include Hand of the King/Queen, Commander of the Kingsguard, Master of Ships, Master of War, Grand Maester, Master of Coin, Master of Whisperers. I personally would have Tywin - Hand of the King, Jaime - Commander of the Kingsguard, Yara Greyjoy - Master of Ships, Stannis Baratheon. Or maybe the iron throne will be destroyed and there won’t be a need for shitty kingdoms since everyone will live happily ever after. bningstider.
