Firstly, if you're new to Ark and would like to play the game in singleplayer, I strongly recommend using the settings from this previous post I made (https://www.reddit.com/r/ARK/comments/9yp4bn/heres_how_to_enjoy_single_player_settings_and/) which also includes explanations of what each setting does so that you can further customize your experience. If you play on PC then while you may still gain some insight by reading these posts you will also have a lot more options to customize your singl.

I just wanted to make a small guide on all the different acronyms in TT2 for new players. Whenever you are joining the game, it can be intimidating to go onto the #builds channel on the community discord server and have people recommending AS and LS and SC and AAw and all this other nonsense that means nothing to you. So sit back, relax, and use your browser’s search function or scroll through this alphabetical list of acronyms. I'm also typing Чтобы открыть Internet Explorer 11 в Windows 10, в поле поиска на панели задач введите Internet Explorer, а затем выберите пункт Internet Explorer из списка результатов. It shocks me as a devoted Firefox user to say this, but Internet Explorer 9 could very well leapfrog the competition in the race of next-generation of web browsers in 2010 thanks to a groundbreaking platform-wide implementation of a hardware-accelerated renderer that I think is quite literally “a free upgrade for the web”. Currently, all I can do on my Dell Inspiron E1505 (32 bit w/ Win XP) is play solitare and access Bing through Internet Explorer. Whenever I want to go to a page that I looked up through Bing, I am redirected to a page saying that I cannot access it. It then lists a few things that could help, but I tried them all to no avail. I did figure out though that I am using an outdated version of internet explorer, and that is why I'm not able to access any pages other than Bing. Because 
Internet Explorer 10 – один из самых популярных интернет обозревателей. Программа обладает большой популярностью благодаря хорошей интеграцией с операционной системой Internet Explorer 10 – программа, входящая в состав стационарных и мобильных операционных систем семейства Windows, которая сама по себе подразумевает использование ее в качестве приложения для Интернет –серфинга. Not only is Internet Explorer 8 like 12 years out of date, it's incredibly shitty like all the other IEs too. I guess I have to tell you the story first: I'd zipped up my original game of MAS into a zip file so I could bring my original files over to my new computer from my first playthrough of DDLC. I hit 'extract files' in WinRar, and I specified a place. Not expecting it to work, I specified the location of the files for IE. It went through. I made a desktop shortcut. It worked. IE no longe.

If you're reading this, you are probably new to Destiny (and /r/Destinythegame) and understandably baffled by this giant and complicated game.

I've had multiple people (mostly new XP users) on this sub ask me what software is available for XP. I've been answering by saying that there's an XP version of virtually all Windows software, and that you can find an XP program to accomplish just abut anything you'd ever want to accomplish on a PC. I've since realized that this leaves them with no starting point and no examples of software a person might want/need to have installed, so I'm posting a small number of recommendations or examples.

Hello guys! I've always wanted to play and finally finish Riven. Unfortunately, both the steam and the GOG version of the game aren't compatible with Windows 10.

Last year, I was given my first job in tech support at my local authority ( LA ), which employed around 10,000 people. At the time, LA was in the midst of a huge IT project upgrading everything from servers to end-user hardware. My two colleagues and I were hired to assist our users (mostly within the 35-65 age range) in making the transition between using their clunky old XP machines EDIT: Unbiased in relation to PROS vs CONS (not going to only say good or bad). I can't believe I actually have to say this. Hi, this was deleted from /r/microsoft by a moderator, so I thought I'd share with the world instead of just Microsoft. I thought it was unbiased, but apparently Microsoft just wants pros: sorry Microsoft.

I know the answer to this question on an XP system but want some feedback from those of you who do this for a living, especially if you do it for outside customers where you might never or rarely support the machine again: The company I work for sells/rents big automated construction equipment and has a third party automation integrator who (as far as I can tell) does a lousy job. I base this assessment off of my experiences trying to get them to fix bugs with their PLC/HMI programs I'm not a techie. I'm a biology student. But I fiddle with computers a lot and have built a few of my own. This makes me frontline tech support for my family, and a few friends. I'm mostly ok with this as nobody has unreasonably taken advantage yet, and it can be kind of fun.

Hello, I did a search for computer/tech/support/geeks etc. and I found your email address. These internet searches are definitely far from perfect so if this is not the type of business you’re in, I apologize and please disregard this email. I’m looking to buy some software that will turn my laptop into a digital voice recorder. If you sell software that will do this, please let me know. I take a lot of classes and it would be really handy if I could record them with the laptop. I haven’t. Hi, Has anyone got both Start Menu/Taskbar customisations and default File Associations respective group policies to work with the latest 1703 Win 10 build? This should not be as hard as it is. What I've tried; Use Export-StartLayout, export the xml file, use the User Configuration or Computer Configuration gt Administrative Templates gtStart Menu and Taskbar GPO and link to the xml file. The result; All programs removed, only Windows 10 apps remain in the entire start menu and where. I recently moved to a new construction home. We had a baby right after the move, and I haven't had time until now to get our network properly set up. I've read through several other threads and am still not sure what the best route is.
